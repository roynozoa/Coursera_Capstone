Jakarta and Surabaya are very popular and most populated metropolitan area in Indonesia. Altough Jakarta have approximately 3 times population than Surabaya, Surabaya has it's own destination, unique places, and landmark to go to. \n",

    "We will use Foursquare API to get data about venues and places in the neighborhood. However there is another popular venues and places in Jakarta or Surabaya neighborhood that is not in the data of Foursquare API. That being said, this article is not the best result for venues and places in the neighborhood, altogh this article is not perfect i hope this will help you or others to know about my analysis.\n",

    "The aim of this report is try to help tourist or business owner to open new detinations or places in the neighborhood depending on the experiences that neighborhood have. Once the data is obtained, the cluster and segmentation between neighborhood is created to see which neighborhood has the same simmilarity based on destination and places. This also will help people to make decision if they are want to migrate or move into another neighborhood.\n",

Using the location of the neighborhood we can search most popular venue or places for each categories using **Foursquare API**. We also need the coordinates/geographical location for each neighborhood in Jakarta and Surabaya. Using the coordinates of the neighborhood we can visualize with **OpenStreetMap using Folium API**.\n",
